title: "Simulating an interactive Twitter workload"

    My latest project has led me to try to simulate workloads from real-world social networks. Starting from Graph500's Kronecker graph and integrating with Retwis, with a sprinkle of my own "retweet behavior", I came up with something that works for me that I thought I'd share.

```{r, include=F}
opts_chunk$set(dev='svg', echo=F, message=F, warning=F, error=F, fig.width=6, fig.height=4)
source('common.R')
```


```{r, echo=T}
d <- data(db("SELECT * FROM tapir WHERE total_time is not null AND name LIKE 'claret-v0.14%'"))
```

```{r time}
ggplot(subset(d, nshards==4 & initusers==4096), aes(
    x=nclients, y=total_time, group=cc, color=cc
))+stat_smooth()+ylab('Time (s)')+xlab('clients')+
theme_mine
```
