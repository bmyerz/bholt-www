I am [officially](https://www.cs.washington.edu/sites/default/files/education/time-sched/teaching2015-2016.html) teaching CSE 351 (Hardware/Software Interface) next <strike>Winter</strike> Spring quarter. This is the first time you get to see end-to-end how computers actually run programs â€” so excited to teach it!
