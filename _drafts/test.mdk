Here's another section. I'm just going to fill it with garbage to try to see if scrolling works.

~ Fig { #fig-scientist caption="A mad scientist." }
![butterfly](../img/mad_scientist.svg){ height=300px }

~ Fig { #fig-riak caption="Riak logo." }

~ Fig { #fig-spampa caption="Sampa lighting talks." }

~ Fig { #fig-papoy caption="Papoy!" }
![papoy](../img/papoy.jpg)

[#fig-scientist] in [the introduction](#sec-intro) shows what a mad scientist is supposed to look like. Note that you can drag&drop images into the editor pane to include them in the document, and similarly with bibtex files, latex style files, etc.

~ Fig { #fig-claret caption="The Claret logo: a wine glass of course." }
![Claret](../img/wineglass-small.jpg){ height=200px }
~
