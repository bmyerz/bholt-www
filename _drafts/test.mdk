# Intro {#sec-intro}
When consistency is critical, developers can enforce stronger guarantees manually, or use serializable transactions in systems like Google's Spanner [@Spanner], but this leaves them with two extremes with a significant performance gap.

Figure [#fig-butterfly] in ยง[#sec-intro] shows a monarch
butterfly. Note that you can drag&drop images into the editor pane to
include them in the document, and similarly with bibtex files, latex
style files, etc.

~ Figure { #fig-butterfly caption="A Monarch butterfly (use the `.wide` class for wide figure)." page-align=top}
![butterfly](../img/papoy.jpg)
~

Okay and this is another thing.
