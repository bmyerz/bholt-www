## About Me
I am a grad student at the University of Washington, pursuing a PhD in Computer Science and Engineering. My research interests include exploring programming models, languages, and compilers for the purposes of exposing and expressing parallelism in a way that existing architectures can use it. My research is done as part of the Computer Architecture group at UW ([Sampa](http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/architecture/projects)), with co-advisors [Luis Ceze](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/luisceze/) and [Mark Oskin](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/oskin). With them, I am working on the [Grappa](http://sampa.cs.washington.edu/grappa) project, an effort to improve performance of irregular applications on commodity clusters in software.

I graduated with a Bachelor's of Science from the University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire, with a comprehensive major in Computer Science and a second major in Physics and Astronomy. In the summer of 2011, I interned at [Cray](http://cray.com) working with [Chapel](http://chapel.cray.com), their new high-productivity programming language for High Performance Computing.

## Research Interests
I am not satisfied with the current tools for developing software for the heterogeneous parallel achitectures that are already nearly ubiquitous. Existing abstractions fail to convey all the information available between layers in the system stack, between the hardware, operating system, runtime system, compiler, and language. The most substantial performance improvements require all the layers to work in concert. High-level constructs are needed that provide useful information but don't over-constrain the implementation. This kind of "vertical optimization" is extremely difficult to accomplish in a general sense, but by narrowing the scope to specific domains such as graph processing, machine learning, or computer vision, the high-level optimization becomes more tractable.

## Projects
Read more about various work in progress and past on the [Projects](projects.html) page. A few highlights:

* [Grappa](http://sampa.cs.washington.edu/grappa): Picking up the slack in commodity clusters for irregular applications.
* [Igor](http://github.com/bholt/igor): A system to make it easier to run parameter sweeps and collect data from experiments.

## Personal
Despite appearances, in addition to locking myself up in a room coding all day, I do other things as well. I enjoy hiking, soccer, frisbee, and sci-fi. I particularly like mountains, in which Washington is not disappointing me.
